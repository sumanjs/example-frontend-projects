# Example front-end projects using Suman for unit testing

Suman can be a better alternative to Mocha and Jasmine in the browser.
A big win is that Suman has support for TypeScript, so you can write your tests using types.

The Suman test harness is compliant with the Karma test runner.

So you can and should use Karma to run your Suman tests in the browser!
